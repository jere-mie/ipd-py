*This code has been written for Assignment 1 of COMP-3710 (Artificial Intelligence) at the University of Windsor, Winter 2023*

## Optimization Strategies Used

3 different optimization strategies have been implemented for trying to find the best deterministic strategy of the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma:

1. Genetic Algorithm
    - Runnable via the `genetic.py` script
2. Hill Climbing
    - Runnable via the `hill_climbing.py` script
3. Tabu Search
    - Runnable via the `tabu_search.py` script
